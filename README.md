# WeatherPy: PlanMyTrip
*25 July 2021*

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to add weather trends as a facet of the PlanMyTrip app in an effort to allow travelers an additional layer of insight into destinations they may like to visit. The package consists of a weather database, vacation search as well as an itinerary for potential road trips within a region.  

## Weather Database
The weather database is a compilation of the maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, windspeed and overall description of 748 cities across the globe. The data was obtained through the use of the Open Weather Map API in conjunction with Python.

## Vacation Search
The vacation search allows travelers to filter cities by their desired temperature range; for the purpose of this example, the range was selected to be between 60 and 70 degrees fahrenheit.
